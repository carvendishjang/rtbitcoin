Recipe

This is a silly game, but still you may be wondering how to play with it:

1. Clone or download tic-tac-toe to a local folder, say "tic-tac-toe"
2. cd tic-tac-toe
3. stack build
4. stack run

About how to install stack, please see https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/
